# QA Manual Tester Portfolio - Maciej Świętochowski



## <a name="aboutme">ABOUT ME</a>

<p>I am a product data operator with five years experience in e-commerce who decided it was <b>time for a change in life!</b>
I was looking for a job that would allow me to <b>grow and use my talents</b>, so I decided to become a QA Manual Tester!</p>

<p>Why did I choose to work as a Manual Tester? My experience in e-commerce made me understand the <b>importance of caring about quality</b>, which translates into <b>customer satisfaction</b>, and I want to use this to test programs. When testing, I always try to break the software or use it in an unusual way. When writing test cases, I try to make the reproduction steps <b>simple and easy</b> for other team members.</p>

<p>During my education I learned <b>SQL, Postman, Jira, TestRail, GIT and HTML/CSS basics</b>, in the future I want to start learning <b>automated testing</b> and get <b>ISTQB certification</b>.</p>
